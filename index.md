## Top 3 Restaurants

1 and 3 are in San Diego - **super delicious**

1. Tacos El Gordo
2. Hangari Kalguksu
3. It's Raw Poke

## Favorite Algorithm: DFS

I like DFS because recursion is so cool

```
def dfs(graph,node):
    global visited
    if node not in visited:
        visited.append(node)
        for n in graph[node]:
            dfs(graph,n)
```
